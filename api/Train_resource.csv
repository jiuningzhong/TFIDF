L-RS,"Evolution is the change that eventually happens over millions of years to better adapt to a habitat or environment change. For example, in the beginning of the world, all the life was simply a few cells floation in the ocean. Then they eventually adapted to ocean life by taking on the form of a axolotl-like fish/lizard. Then they grew legs and lungs and came to land as an early form of lizards. These adapted into dinosaurs. Dinosaurs went extinct, but many species of moles and mice.
