i learn that at first i think that moss do not have any root but now i find out that moss actually moss have tiny small root and that moss be eukaryotic mean  cell have nucleus that also contain cell wall call cellulose there also autotrophic which mean  make  own food  also carry a photosynthesis witch make carbon carbon dioxide into sugar in order for moss to grow in other place there have to be other moss to send around spore if  land somewhere with the right temperature than  can grow correctly seedless plant be separate into different group vascular and nonvascular vascular have canal that carry water throughout  body nonvascular plant or bryophyte instead of collect water from there root  collect water though there thin cell wall  do not grow more than a few centimeter tall thin rootlike rhizoid hold the plant down and also absorb water from the ground  will find bryophyte all around the world mostly in rain forest and pond and stream moss be the most common bryophyte clump in layer on tree trunk the ground or even rock moss and liverwort be the first plant to live harsh place

photosynthesis occur when a plant soak up water through  root absorb carbon dioxide   through opening in the leave call stomata and store energy from sunlight as chemical energy the water travel up the plant stem through a transport tissue calledxylem the water and   spread through the leave into cell calledthe palisade and the spongy cell the cell be fill with structure call chloroplast which contain a green pigment call chlorophyll chlorophyll split the water into molecule of hydrogen and oxygen atom the sunlight chemical energy be use to create glucose from the hydrogen and carbon dioxide the glucose dissolve into extra water molecule and give the plant an extra boost of energy that  need to grow the plant give off the oxygen atom as a waste product

the blade orlamina be the broad flat part of the leaf photosynthesis occur in the blade which have many green foodmaking cell leaf blade differ from one another in several way   the type of edge   the pattern of the vein and   the number of blade per leaf 
 the type of edgesalmost all narrow grasslike leave and needle leave have a blade with a smooth edge as do many broadleaf plant particularly those that be native to warm climate the rubber plant a common house plant be a good example of such a plant 
 the leave of many temperate broadleaf plant have small jagged point call tooth along the blade edge birch and elm tree have such leave some plant havehydathode tiny valvelike structure that can release excess water from the leaf the tooth of young leave on many plant include cottonwood and pin cherry tree bear tiny glad these gland produce liquid that protect the young leaf from planteate insect 
 some temperate broadleaf plant   include sassafra tree and certain mulberry and oak tree   have lob leave the edge of such a leaf look as if large bite have be take out of  this lobing help heat escape from the leaf

big animal in the food chain kill small animal but small animal can kill big animal say if there in a pack then  could take down a big animal 
 i think fish do not need air to breath because  have some kind of organe in there body that let  breath in water and have no need for air 
 scientific method be way of make there question better then  be before 
 science should real step up  game by do other thing 
 the courtyard interaction the courtyard interaction and i have be focus on be the apple tree change during each season   be the tree dead will  have  leave again 
 the courtyard have a lot of die stuff include tree animal and grass and plant 
 scientist be work on a solution so plant do not die in the winter i hope  happen 
 why and how do the animale get in the cortyard 
 stop follow  i want to be alone
