L-QS,"I noticed that moss grows alot in places, in trees on the ground and rocks

[    I need to understand  -Why there are rotting apples on the ground out of nowhere. Do animals and weather make this happen? Does time matter?
[    My theory  -I'm thinking rotting apples happen when insects go through eating the apple (sometimes happens) , when it's finished, the apple has less enerygy so time makes it rot. - ]

L-QS,"I know that LIVING things eat to grow bigger. I can see that the fuzzy stuff is getting bigger and the fruit is shrinking. This makes me think the fuzzy stuff is a living thing. Since the fruit is from a plant, and I know that decomposers eat plants, I think the fuzzy stuff on the fruit is a decomposer. I need to understand Where did the decomposer come from? I need to understand How is this mini ecosystem like our larger GES COURTYARD ECOSYSTEM?"

L-QS,"I noticed that moss grows alot in places, in trees on the ground and rocks [    (missing link)  - that moss grows in many different places. I know trees, ground and rocks have minerals. Does that help moss grow on those places? [    (missing link)  - is that moss grows in many different places because it spreads when moss fully covers rocks or the ground."

L-QF,why do people need water.
L-QS,"[    This theory cannot explain - ifour water is coming from the ocean water that evaporates and later rains, does rain water have salt in it, too?"
L-QS,[    I need to understand  - why we can't just boil the salt out of the water and filter it. Also if the water is moving from the ocean to rivers to lakes and streams where it gets cleaned and drinked then why can't we just take out the salt and clean the ocean water - ]     of couse then we would have to see how to get it to people in need but still why can't we just do that stuff to the sea water and just deel with it if it is clean it makes no sense!
L-QS,[    I need to understand that why some people can get to water so fast and other people can't. Is it because those countries are hotter and water evaporates faster or is it because they don't have the technology that we have here and we have water pipes and other countries don't?
