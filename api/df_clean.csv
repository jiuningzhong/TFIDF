primitive mosses similar to the hundreds of moss species found in appalachia might have triggered two cool periods around  million years ago according to a recent study published earlier this year in nature geoscience the study suggests that early mosses clinging to prehistoric rocks sped up the weathering of certain minerals from those rocks the release of these minerals accelerated the pace of carbon sequestration leading to cooler temperatures that paved the way for further plant and animal evolution","wait hailey i think -PRON- be right but the spore be not only for the wind -PRON- be also for the moss to grow let -PRON- explain -PRON- to -PRON-
