first of all the cycle starts off as a seed then the seed gets carbon dioxide water sunlight to grow after it gets all of those things the seed turns into a small tree and grows out of the ground this is when the tree also starts to grow roots after this step the small tree turns into an apple tree this is when the tree grows apples after the tree starts getting weak it loses its apples when the apples fall to the ground and die the seeds are exposed they go back in the ground or the wind blows them away and moves them to some place else this is how the cycle keeps on going,first of all the cycle start off as a seed then the seed get carbon dioxide water sunlight to grow after -PRON- get all of those thing the seed turn into a small tree and grow out of the ground this be when the tree also start to grow root after this step the small tree turn into an apple tree this be when the tree grow apple after the tree start get weak -PRON- lose -PRON- apple when the apple fall to the ground and die the seed be expose -PRON- go back in the ground or the wind blow -PRON- away and move -PRON- to some place else this be how the cycle keep on go
i know that ants are decomposers when they eat they leave a trail of left over bits of food that add nutrients to the soil i know that ants are aggressive i learned that the ant population can impact the population of other species in an area if the ant population goes down other species in that area will go up my theory if an ant population goes up other speciespopulation will go down many ants work together to take out other species a better theory without ants and other decomposers the soil would not get nutrients without the nutrients inthe soil the plants that grow there would not get what they need to grow strong with nutrients then the animals that eat the plants wont have the best nutrients they need humans who eat the animals that eat the plants wont get the nutrients they need to get bigger and stronger and survive in healthy ways ants are an interesting and important species i need to understand what are the nutrients in the soil that plants and animals and humans need,i know that ant be decomposer when -PRON- eat -PRON- leave a trail of leave over bit of food that add nutrient to the soil i know that ant be aggressive i learn that the ant population can impact the population of other specie in an area if the ant population go down other specie in that area will go up -PRON- theory if an ant population go up other speciespopulation will go down many ant work together to take out other specie a well theory without ant and other decomposer the soil would not get nutrient without the nutrient inthe soil the plant that grow there would not get what -PRON- need to grow strong with nutrient then the animal that eat the plant will not have the good nutrient -PRON- need human who eat the animal that eat the plant will not get the nutrient -PRON- need to get big and strong and survive in healthy way ant be an interesting and important specie i need to understand what be the nutrient in the soil that plant and animal and human need
i learned that at first i thought that moss did not have any roots but now i found out that moss actually moss has tiny small roots and that moss is eukaryotic meaning their cells have nucleus that also contain cell wall called cellulose there also autotrophic which means they make their own food they also carry a photosynthesis witch makes carbon carbon dioxide into sugar in order for moss to grow in other places there has to be other moss to send around spores if it lands somewhere with the right temperature than it can grow correctly seedless plants are separated into different groups vascular and nonvascular vascular have canals that carry water throughout their body nonvascular plants or bryophytes instead of collecting water from there roots they collect water though there thin cell walls they don’t grow more than a few centimeters tall thin rootlike rhizoids holds the plants down and also absorb water from the ground you will find bryophytes all around the world mostly in rain forests and ponds and streams mosses are the most common bryophytes clumped in layers on tree trunks the ground or even rocks moss and liverworts were the first plants to live harsh places,i learn that at first i think that moss do not have any root but now i find out that moss actually moss have tiny small root and that moss be eukaryotic mean -PRON- cell have nucleus that also contain cell wall call cellulose there also autotrophic which mean -PRON- make -PRON- own food -PRON- also carry a photosynthesis witch make carbon carbon dioxide into sugar in order for moss to grow in other place there have to be other moss to send around spore if -PRON- land somewhere with the right temperature than -PRON- can grow correctly seedless plant be separate into different group vascular and nonvascular vascular have canal that carry water throughout -PRON- body nonvascular plant or bryophyte instead of collect water from there root -PRON- collect water though there thin cell wall -PRON- do not grow more than a few centimeter tall thin rootlike rhizoid hold the plant down and also absorb water from the ground -PRON- will find bryophyte all around the world mostly in rain forest and pond and stream moss be the most common bryophyte clump in layer on tree trunk the ground or even rock moss and liverwort be the first plant to live harsh place
i used to think that not alot of insects can live in moss because moss insects are pretty big like a big ant but there’s a insect called a tardigrade a tardigrade is a insect that lives in or around moss so if a tardigrade can live in moss that mean other insects can live or can they because a tardigrade is microscopic so there’s a lot of space for the tardigrade now i think that moss can’t really provide a home or insects because a ant lives underground so if ants lives on moss when it rain the rain will wash the ants away,i use to think that not alot of insect can live in moss because moss insect be pretty big like a big ant but there ’s a insect call a tardigrade a tardigrade be a insect that live in or around moss so if a tardigrade can live in moss that mean other insect can live or can -PRON- because a tardigrade be microscopic so there ’s a lot of space for the tardigrade now i think that moss can not really provide a home or insect because a ant live underground so if ant live on moss when -PRON- rain the rain will wash the ant away

i ve learned that all living things are linked together by what they eat for example say if there were no more shrimp the amount animals that eat the shrimp will start to decrease and it would just keep on decreasing also did you know that the food web can contain lost and lots of animals in it the food web has three main elements producers consumers and decomposers producers are plants they make their own food out of the sun also known as photosynthasis  the producers are mostly at the bottom of the food chain consumers cant make their own food so they eat the producers primary consumers are herbavors secondary consumers are carnivors and some consumers are omnivors also there are parasite cosumers decomposers are mostly bacteria they help to brake down dead animals or dead plants or any of those dead things,i ve learn that all live thing be link together by what -PRON- eat for example say if there be no more shrimp the amount animal that eat the shrimp will start to decrease and -PRON- would just keep on decrease also do -PRON- know that the food web can contain lose and lot of animal in -PRON- the food web have three main element producer consumer and decomposer producer be plant -PRON- make -PRON- own food out of the sun also know as photosynthasis   the producer be mostly at the bottom of the food chain consumer can not make -PRON- own food so -PRON- eat the producer primary consumer be herbavor secondary consumer be carnivor and some consumer be omnivor also there be parasite cosumer decomposer be mostly bacteria -PRON- help to brake down dead animal or dead plant or any of those dead thing
leaves have unique structures called veins that transport liquids and nutrients to leaf cells veins also carry the products of photosynthesis back to the rest of the tree a tree leaf has several types of veins the central one is called the midrib or midvein other veins connect to the midrib and have their own unique patterns tree leaf veins in dicots we also call these trees hardwoods or deciduous trees are all considered to be netveined or reticulateveined this means that the veins branch from the main rib and then subbranch into finer veins there are two classifications you need to,leave have unique structure call vein that transport liquid and nutrient to leaf cell vein also carry the product of photosynthesis back to the rest of the tree a tree leaf have several type of vein the central one be call the midrib or midvein other vein connect to the midrib and have -PRON- own unique pattern tree leaf vein in dicot -PRON- also call these tree hardwood or deciduous tree be all consider to be netveine or reticulateveine this mean that the vein branch from the main rib and then subbranch into finer vein there be two classification -PRON- need to

my theory is that most water are dirty in villages and if we install filters in villages so they can be clean,-PRON- theory be that most water be dirty in village and if -PRON- install filter in village so -PRON- can be clean
why isnt africas water system as well as ours,why be not africas water system as well as ours
it might be because they dont have the resources,-PRON- may be because -PRON- do not have the resource
how are they able to find resources,how be -PRON- able to find resource
i think its because there is not a lot of bodies of water and they have a lot of  world countries that can not afford wells,i think -PRON- because there be not a lot of body of water and -PRON- have a lot of   world country that can not afford well
some countries dont have the water they need because the dont have the equipment to filter and distribute it to more people,some country do not have the water -PRON- need because the do not have the equipment to filter and distribute -PRON- to more people
some countries also dont have much water because of a drout or of a water shortage from a war or hot weather,some country also do not have much water because of a drout or of a water shortage from a war or hot weather
today we did a water challenge the challenge was that you had to move  of water  centimeters to another beaker the challenge was a bit hard at first but when we got a hang of it,today -PRON- do a water challenge the challenge be that -PRON- have to move   of water   centimeter to another beaker the challenge be a bit hard at first but when -PRON- get a hang of -PRON-
i need to understand how would water get to those in need my theory is that you could build underground tubes instead of over ground tubes that way you can deliver watr without it interfearing with roads and buildings,i need to understand how would water get to those in need -PRON- theory be that -PRON- could build underground tube instead of over ground tube that way -PRON- can deliver watr without -PRON- interfeare with road and building
maybe we can install underground pipes that go to all of the villages and then the water can go through a filter and be cleaned and ready to drink,maybe -PRON- can install underground pipe that go to all of the village and then the water can go through a filter and be clean and ready to drink
so my theroy is that we could we can put water towers in different areas then we put pipes in,so -PRON- theroy be that -PRON- could -PRON- can put water tower in different area then -PRON- put pipe in
evaporation is water water is steaming,evaporation be water water be steam
our plan worked here are our stuff we had  tubes   way valve  connectors  beakers always and a sringe and a measuring tape,-PRON- plan work here be -PRON- stuff -PRON- have   tube    way valve   connector   beaker always and a sringe and a measuring tape
putting our knowledge together when we worked in teams of   we made a tube that we could fill water with and we made it to the second challange,put -PRON- knowledge together when -PRON- work in team of    -PRON- make a tube that -PRON- could fill water with and -PRON- make -PRON- to the second challange
during this experiment i learned its kinda hard to transfor the water to the cup because you have to come up with a plan etc,during this experiment i learn -PRON- kinda hard to transfor the water to the cup because -PRON- have to come up with a plan etc
well i guess it could be hard if you did not have a plan but other wise it would not be that hard,well i guess -PRON- could be hard if -PRON- do not have a plan but other wise -PRON- would not be that hard
why does africas water dry up so quickly,why do africas water dry up so quickly
it was fun to do with classmates and easy it didnt really make a big mess for us my questions are can we go longer and can it get harder cuz what we did was easy,-PRON- be fun to do with classmate and easy -PRON- do not really make a big mess for -PRON- -PRON- question be can -PRON- go longer and can -PRON- get hard cuz what -PRON- did be easy
i need to understand how filters work,i need to understand how filter work

starit was esey up thehoill,starit be esey up thehoill
my theory is that we used the brown filter first than we used a carben then white filter and  ,-PRON- theory be that -PRON- use the brown filter first than -PRON- use a carben then white filter and  
our nitrate level was  our groups plan is in my section but failure is a road to sucsecion,-PRON- nitrate level be   -PRON- group plan be in -PRON- section but failure be a road to sucsecion
they should filter the water if its dirty so its healthy or add pipes around so its not as hard to get water,-PRON- should filter the water if -PRON- dirty so -PRON- healthy or add pipe around so -PRON- not as hard to get water
why do we have a better water system than other counries what makes it different for them is it because the other countries are hotter than ours like africa,why do -PRON- have a well water system than other counrie what make -PRON- different for -PRON- be -PRON- because the other country be hot than our like africa
yeah africa is closer to equator,yeah africa be close to equator
what weill happed if you drink too much water will you be fine,what weill happe if -PRON- drink too much water will -PRON- be fine

i am wondering what would happen if you instead of having water for two weeks you drank sugar drinks,i be wonder what would happen if -PRON- instead of have water for two week -PRON- drank sugar drink
my theory is that if you drank only sugar drinks for  weeks these could be some of the results you might get diabetes your teethmight rot and fall out you might have a hyperactivity seizure your organs might get weaker because they had too much sugar energy and shorted out you would gain a lot of weight you might get dehydrated if there is caffeine in your drinks your blood sugars can spike and drop making you hyper and tired,-PRON- theory be that if -PRON- drank only sugar drink for   week these could be some of the result -PRON- may get diabetes -PRON- teethmight rot and fall out -PRON- may have a hyperactivity seizure -PRON- organ may get weak because -PRON- have too much sugar energy and short out -PRON- would gain a lot of weight -PRON- may get dehydrate if there be caffeine in -PRON- drink -PRON- blood sugar can spike and drop make -PRON- hyper and tired
i think what would happen is it could would dmage your teeth and youcould get diabetes like erica said you may not be able to survive it may be like drinking saltwater instead of regular water you cant survive if you just drink saltwater,i think what would happen be -PRON- could would dmage -PRON- tooth and youcould get diabete like erica say -PRON- may not be able to survive -PRON- may be like drinking saltwater instead of regular water -PRON- can not survive if -PRON- just drink saltwater
africas water dries up more quickly because they are closer to the equator,africas water dry up more quickly because -PRON- be close to the equator
yes thatsn right but some of the gose to the trees and dose not dry up and it stays under ground,yes thatsn right but some of the gose to the tree and dose not dry up and -PRON- stay under ground
my theory is that soda is way unhealither than water soda has sugar and other unhealther products water has just water is there any other differences,-PRON- theory be that soda be way unhealither than water soda have sugar and other unhealther product water have just water be there any other difference
i know that one diffrense is that sugar drinks have stuff likecornsyrupnatral flavorslots of sugarlots of lactose,i know that one diffrense be that sugar drink have stuff likecornsyrupnatral flavorslot of sugarlot of lactose

we have so much water in the ocean whats the point of making water,-PRON- have so much water in the ocean what s the point of make water
again i didnt say that humans should start making water and ocean water has salt in it if we drink too much humans will die thats what some people are trying to figure out how to get salt out of the salt water but your obviously not listening i know google dosnt know everything i said find a website,again i do not say that human should start make water and ocean water have salt in -PRON- if -PRON- drink too much human will die that s what some people be try to figure out how to get salt out of the salt water but -PRON- obviously not listen i know google dosnt know everything i say find a website

hey timy they already made a filter that can trancfer the salt out of salt water,hey timy -PRON- already make a filter that can trancfer the salt out of salt water
putting our knowledge together if there is already something that can get the salt out of salt water than we would not be having this unit,put -PRON- knowledge together if there be already something that can get the salt out of salt water than -PRON- would not be have this unit
the reason why is that it is very expensive to desalinate water,the reason why be that -PRON- be very expensive to desalinate water
i need to understand why we cant just boil the salt out of the water and filter it also if the water is moving from the ocean to rivers to lakes and streams where it gets cleaned and drinked then why cant we just take out the salt and clean the ocean water of couse then we would have to see how to get it to people in need but still why cant we just do that stuff to the sea water and just deel with it if it is clean it makes no sense,i need to understand why -PRON- can not just boil the salt out of the water and filter -PRON- also if the water be move from the ocean to river to lake and stream where -PRON- get clean and drink then why can not -PRON- just take out the salt and clean the ocean water of couse then -PRON- would have to see how to get -PRON- to people in need but still why can not -PRON- just do that stuff to the sea water and just deel with -PRON- if -PRON- be clean -PRON- make no sense

i know that  hydrogen atoms and  oxygen atom also known as  so if we combine those i think we might get water,i know that   hydrogen atom and   oxygen atom also know as   so if -PRON- combine those i think -PRON- may get water
i fully agree with you on this topic but i have a question how do the hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms bond,i fully agree with -PRON- on this topic but i have a question how do the hydrogen atom and oxygen atom bond
if we put   hydrogen and   oxygen in a container then we might turn out with water if we can get a big chunk of a glacier then we can melt it and give more water to countries in need,if -PRON- put    hydrogen and    oxygen in a container then -PRON- may turn out with water if -PRON- can get a big chunk of a glacier then -PRON- can melt -PRON- and give more water to country in need
we can not bind the two but i was thinking the same thing about both,-PRON- can not bind the two but i be think the same thing about both
what if we had fiters that can filter the salt out of salt water oh wait we do so why can´t we just take a lot of those filter and put thenm all around the world and then peopl can get fresh water all the time and the fresh water can go to alot of good cause and all those cause are food and health,what if -PRON- have fiter that can filter the salt out of salt water oh wait -PRON- do so why can´t -PRON- just take a lot of those filter and put thenm all around the world and then peopl can get fresh water all the time and the fresh water can go to alot of good cause and all those cause be food and health
i need to understand that why some people can get to water so fast and other people cant is it because those countries are hotter and water evaporates faster or is it because they dont have the technology that we have here and we have water pipes and other countries dont,i need to understand that why some people can get to water so fast and other people can not be -PRON- because those country be hot and water evaporate faster or be -PRON- because -PRON- do not have the technology that -PRON- have here and -PRON- have water pipe and other country do not

why cant salva just make a water filter,why can not salva just make a water filter
salva doesnt have the mateirials,salva do not have the mateirial
my theory is that we should build filters in big factories and transport water all around the world and check if the filters take out the salt in the water,-PRON- theory be that -PRON- should build filter in big factory and transport water all around the world and check if the filter take out the salt in the water
one way to get fresh water is to melt glaciers into water i know this because if you melt snow or ice it becomes water,one way to get fresh water be to melt glacier into water i know this because if -PRON- melt snow or ice -PRON- become water

so i think that our  part filter was good but we messed up on the actived carbon because we did not put in a filter so the water would just stay there,so i think that -PRON-   part filter be good but -PRON- mess up on the actived carbon because -PRON- do not put in a filter so the water would just stay there
when we made the filter we used the w filter a carbon and then b filter when we filterd the water it turned out clear,when -PRON- make the filter -PRON- use the w filter a carbon and then b filter when -PRON- filterd the water -PRON- turn out clear
when i did the thing which you have to try to turn the dirty water into clean it was kinda hard because my group sometimes fight but we did it but we thought we could use more of the active carbon but that made the water cloudy and dirty it clean before we use all the active carbon,when i do the thing which -PRON- have to try to turn the dirty water into clean -PRON- be kinda hard because -PRON- group sometimes fight but -PRON- do -PRON- but -PRON- think -PRON- could use more of the active carbon but that make the water cloudy and dirty -PRON- clean before -PRON- use all the active carbon
water is much more healthier than soda i know this because soda has a lot of sugar in it but water doesnt have sugar,water be much more healthy than soda i know this because soda have a lot of sugar in -PRON- but water do not have sugar

many people cannot get to water because of water scarcity i think water scarcity is when people cant get water i think that also most people dont know how to get water because they dont have the proper education like how nya didnt know how to get water from under the ground because she did not know,many people can not get to water because of water scarcity i think water scarcity be when people can not get water i think that also most people do not know how to get water because -PRON- do not have the proper education like how nya do not know how to get water from under the ground because -PRON- did not know
during the filtering expriement we did i learned that if we add to much a carbon it turns the water all black and cloudy in conclusion dont put a lot of a carbon in the water to filter it ,during the filter expriement -PRON- do i learn that if -PRON- add to much a carbon -PRON- turn the water all black and cloudy in conclusion do not put a lot of a carbon in the water to filter -PRON-
when we first filtered our water it still had some bule in it from when it was dirty but when i was cleaning up i realised that it looked cealer it had no more color my theory is that filters work better over time,when -PRON- first filter -PRON- water -PRON- still have some bule in -PRON- from when -PRON- be dirty but when i be clean up i realise that -PRON- look cealer -PRON- have no more color -PRON- theory be that filter work better over time

when we did our latest project it was about filtering water unfortunetly our water was gray i think it was becuase of too much air carbon we used it in two of our steps instead of one next time we need less carbon and also switch the steps around filtering water is important because nyas sister got sick from drinking dirty water my theory is that she got sick because there are actually nitrates in dirty water an nitrates arent good for the human body new information that i want to learn is what chemicals are in nitrate and how are they bad for us to drink and how are they made exactly,when -PRON- do -PRON- late project -PRON- be about filter water unfortunetly -PRON- water be gray i think -PRON- be becuase of too much air carbon -PRON- use -PRON- in two of -PRON- step instead of one next time -PRON- need less carbon and also switch the step around filter water be important because nyas sister get sick from drink dirty water -PRON- theory be that -PRON- get sick because there be actually nitrate in dirty water an nitrate be not good for the human body new information that i want to learn be what chemical be in nitrate and how be -PRON- bad for -PRON- to drink and how be -PRON- make exactly
new information i learned was that with my group we saw way to filter wateruseing coffe filters it was so fun because when where doing the project and i saw that we were all having fun in the processe we also saw that we learned from our mistakes we had clear water but we though that it coud be more clean so we added more carbon and the clear water with the left over dirty water but it didnt turn out as planed so thats all i have to tell you about my team project i hope i tought you all something,new information i learn be that with -PRON- group -PRON- see way to filter waterusee coffe filter -PRON- be so fun because when where do the project and i see that -PRON- be all have fun in the processe -PRON- also see that -PRON- learn from -PRON- mistake -PRON- have clear water but -PRON- though that -PRON- coud be more clean so -PRON- add more carbon and the clear water with the left over dirty water but -PRON- do not turn out as plane so that s all i have to tell -PRON- about -PRON- team project i hope i tought -PRON- all something

how a shadow is made a light nose on a big object,how a shadow be make a light nose on a big object
rainbows are when light goes through rain droplets that act like prisms,rainbow be when light go through rain droplet that act like prism
the order of colors in the rainbow goes red orange yellow green blue indigo violet its in that order because of the light waves red is the longest light wave and violet is the shortest light wave,the order of color in the rainbow go red orange yellow green blue indigo violet -PRON- in that order because of the light wave red be the long light wave and violet be the short light wave
this is how we see different colored objects when you see a yellow flower it is because all the primary colors of light hit it red and green light bounce off of the flower into your eye,this be how -PRON- see different colored object when -PRON- see a yellow flower -PRON- be because all the primary color of light hit -PRON- red and green light bounce off of the flower into -PRON- eye
its the same with magenta except blue red nonces off,-PRON- the same with magenta except blue red nonce off
its also the same with cyan except blue green light bounces off,-PRON- also the same with cyan except blue green light bounce off
shadows are made when light hits an opaque object and so then it makes shadow the shadow is allays attacher to a opaque object,shadow be make when light hit an opaque object and so then -PRON- make shadow the shadow be allays attacher to a opaque object

humans are a major part of our ecosystem so this is the perfect next unit am i right,human be a major part of -PRON- ecosystem so this be the perfect next unit be i right
humans get energy by getting food and water into their stomach however for the humans to get energy the food needs to first grow so lets take an orange for example first the sun will give energy to a type of plant the plant will become a fullgrownplant and then things will start to grow on the plant the things on the plat are oranges then the oranges will be eaten by a human however the human first needs to eat the orange and then the orange will need to go into the humans body first it will go into the esophagusa tube that leads to your stomach now the energy is in your stomach but some of the food will continue to go through the small intestine and the large intestine which will soon be digested,human get energy by get food and water into -PRON- stomach however for the human to get energy the food need to first grow so let take an orange for example first the sun will give energy to a type of plant the plant will become a fullgrownplant and then thing will start to grow on the plant the thing on the plat be orange then the orange will be eat by a human however the human first need to eat the orange and then the orange will need to go into the human body first -PRON- will go into the esophagusa tube that lead to -PRON- stomach now the energy be in -PRON- stomach but some of the food will continue to go through the small intestine and the large intestine which will soon be digest
i agree about that because there is different sections of the brain that controll your body parts and your thoughts so i totally agree with you,i agree about that because there be different section of the brain that controll -PRON- body part and -PRON- thought so i totally agree with -PRON-
i agree and also peoples sleep paralysis gets really strong that they think it happens in real life and they need to go to atherapist and help their condition grow out of it and sleep paralysis have it from their family or if you have seen a lot of scary stuff in your life or maybe if you were an preist before and you quit you can face sleep paralysis and it would be scary and sleep paralysis can also cause sleep walking,i agree and also people sleep paralysis get really strong that -PRON- think -PRON- happen in real life and -PRON- need to go to atherapist and help -PRON- condition grow out of -PRON- and sleep paralysis have -PRON- from -PRON- family or if -PRON- have see a lot of scary stuff in -PRON- life or maybe if -PRON- be an preist before and -PRON- quit -PRON- can face sleep paralysis and -PRON- would be scary and sleep paralysis can also cause sleep walk
i am wondering how your immune sytem fights of sickness,i be wonder how -PRON- immune sytem fight of sickness

i dont agree to this your brain stem does not send messeges to your body your brain tells your nerves to move and do stuff with your body also you brain stem does not control your feeling its in your limbic system which makes you have feelings so when you said you wouldnt be able to cry without your brain stem that false infomation also its true if you dont have your brain stem you could die because you couldnt brath or pump blood,i do not agree to this -PRON- brain stem do not send messege to -PRON- body -PRON- brain tell -PRON- nerve to move and do stuff with -PRON- body also -PRON- brain stem do not control -PRON- feel -PRON- in -PRON- limbic system which make -PRON- have feeling so when -PRON- say -PRON- would not be able to cry without -PRON- brain stem that false infomation also -PRON- true if -PRON- do not have -PRON- brain stem -PRON- could die because -PRON- could not brath or pump blood
i dont think we would be able to live because if we are unaware of what is going on we would most likely be hit by cars or have something bad happen because you were not paying attion,i do not think -PRON- would be able to live because if -PRON- be unaware of what be go on -PRON- would most likely be hit by car or have something bad happen because -PRON- be not pay attion
i dont think you can do that because i think the brain has different sections of the brain that control your body and your thoughts,i do not think -PRON- can do that because i think the brain have different section of the brain that control -PRON- body and -PRON- thought
i dont know some of the words in this note do you know what some of the words mean,i do not know some of the word in this note do -PRON- know what some of the word mean
i dont know yet but i am starting to figure it out,i do not know yet but i be start to figure -PRON- out
i found out that heart connects to the brain because they both have neutrons that are very similar to each other those neurons connect to emotions and both the heart and the brain actually produce strong emotions,i find out that heart connect to the brain because -PRON- both have neutron that be very similar to each other those neuron connect to emotion and both the heart and the brain actually produce strong emotion
i have a theory when you are in a coma your brain is shut down and can not do anything like it is sleeping in a deep sleep like aurora it can wake itself up eventually but it is very hard to wake up i need to understand is my theory true or false,i have a theory when -PRON- be in a coma -PRON- brain be shut down and can not do anything like -PRON- be sleep in a deep sleep like aurora -PRON- can wake -PRON- up eventually but -PRON- be very hard to wake up i need to understand be -PRON- theory true or false
i have been wondering how long does it take for our bodies my theory is that it matter on the size of the food that you eat,i have be wonder how long do -PRON- take for -PRON- body -PRON- theory be that -PRON- matter on the size of the food that -PRON- eat
i have been wondering where does the food go when we eat it i know it goes into our stomach but where does it go before you go to the bathroom there has to be something in between,i have be wonder where do the food go when -PRON- eat -PRON- i know -PRON- go into -PRON- stomach but where do -PRON- go before -PRON- go to the bathroom there have to be something in between
i just learned that there is acids inside of the stomach that really matter if you didnt have those acids the whole digestive system wouldnt function correctly and would cause not being able to absorb nutrients which would make you more lazy or tired or just sit around being halfhearted all day long the acids break down more than before breaking down in the mouth for chemical digestion but the acids are like the leaders of the stomach they break down any food that is able to break down in to really small molecules that fit into the large intestine,i just learn that there be acid inside of the stomach that really matter if -PRON- do not have those acid the whole digestive system would not function correctly and would cause not be able to absorb nutrient which would make -PRON- more lazy or tired or just sit around be halfhearte all day long the acid break down more than before break down in the mouth for chemical digestion but the acid be like the leader of the stomach -PRON- break down any food that be able to break down in to really small molecule that fit into the large intestine
i just wanted to add that it is not that simple and it also goes throgh your througt and into your stomach then gets diagested by acids and then goes down in where it gets sent down and all the nutrients inside it go into the body and waste goes outside of the body,i just want to add that -PRON- be not that simple and -PRON- also go throgh -PRON- througt and into -PRON- stomach then get diageste by acid and then go down in where -PRON- get send down and all the nutrient inside -PRON- go into the body and waste go outside of the body
i know that the apple sugar goes to the blood i wonder how the blood can get you stronger and healthier my theory is when the sugar goes to the blood the blood gets more healthier and then your muscles work much better,i know that the apple sugar go to the blood i wonder how the blood can get -PRON- strong and healthy -PRON- theory be when the sugar go to the blood the blood get more healthy and then -PRON- muscle work much better
i know that the brain uses different parts of it to control the body and to get information from but i want to know what parts it uses for a paticular thing,i know that the brain use different part of -PRON- to control the body and to get information from but i want to know what part -PRON- use for a paticular thing
i observed that when we humans think of apples we think of juciey treats that are a beloved fruits we dont think of the energy that is entering are body once we eat it i know the apple enters our system of are body ready to digest after being chewed and swallowed after it ids digested you feel like have more energy because you do the energy flows around our body for a whlie then it comes out my theroy is that the energy starts flowing throgh are bodys after  hours of digesting my question is that why are apples diffrent colors yet they can grow in the sam place,i observe that when -PRON- human think of apple -PRON- think of juciey treat that be a beloved fruit -PRON- do not think of the energy that be enter be body once -PRON- eat -PRON- i know the apple enter -PRON- system of be body ready to digest after be chew and swallow after -PRON- id digest -PRON- feel like have more energy because -PRON- do the energy flow around -PRON- body for a whlie then -PRON- come out -PRON- theroy be that the energy start flow throgh be bodys after   hour of digest -PRON- question be that why be apple diffrent color yet -PRON- can grow in the sam place
i think that when you eat the food goes into pieces and goes through your body and goes to you stomach,i think that when -PRON- eat the food go into piece and go through -PRON- body and go to -PRON- stomach

my question is how dose the brain connect to  this blank can be filled with lots on lots of things like thoughts tempature dreams balence movement breathing digesting and growth i can and will answer all of this look at my other notes for refrence q thoughts a cerebrum q temature a hypothalamus q dreams a cerebrum q balence a cerebellum q movement a cerebellum q breathing a brainstem q digesting a brainstem q growth a pituitary i still have a lot of things to fill in this blank and i hope to answer my question even more than it is,-PRON- question be how dose the brain connect to   this blank can be fill with lot on lot of thing like thought tempature dream balence movement breathing digesting and growth i can and will answer all of this look at -PRON- other note for refrence q thought a cerebrum q temature a hypothalamus q dream a cerebrum q balence a cerebellum q movement a cerebellum q breathe a brainstem q digest a brainstem q growth a pituitary i still have a lot of thing to fill in this blank and i hope to answer -PRON- question even more than -PRON- be
my question is that when my feet have a reaction my theory is that sometimes that my feet start tingle and i want to know why that happens when my feet start to tinle and try to walk its like a really hard tingle so that my question,-PRON- question be that when -PRON- foot have a reaction -PRON- theory be that sometimes that -PRON- foot start tingle and i want to know why that happen when -PRON- foot start to tinle and try to walk -PRON- like a really hard tingle so that -PRON- question
my questionswhy do we have a certain eye colorhow did we get the eye color that we have nowwhy do we have a certain hair colorhow did we get the hair color we have knowwhat i have figured out about my questions so farwe all have two genes that are color genes we can have two different color ones or two of the same color ones if you have one brown gene and one a different color you will have brown eyes and brown hair because brown genes are more dominant if someone has brown hair that doesnt mean that both of their genes have to be brown if your parent has brown hair and a brown and a different color gene and your other parent has the other color two then you could possibly have that color you could even have a different hair and eye color than your twin if you have a twin,-PRON- questionswhy do -PRON- have a certain eye colorhow do -PRON- get the eye color that -PRON- have nowwhy do -PRON- have a certain hair colorhow do -PRON- get the hair color -PRON- have knowwhat i have figure out about -PRON- question so farwe all have two gene that be color gene -PRON- can have two different color one or two of the same color one if -PRON- have one brown gene and one a different color -PRON- will have brown eye and brown hair because brown gene be more dominant if someone have brown hair that do not mean that both of -PRON- gene have to be brown if -PRON- parent have brown hair and a brown and a different color gene and -PRON- other parent have the other color two then -PRON- could possibly have that color -PRON- could even have a different hair and eye color than -PRON- twin if -PRON- have a twin
nutrients and vitamins are not only for teeth and bones but muscles also need nutrients and vitamins muscles carry energy with them so that they do not get weak all the time if there is no calcuim for the muscles in your body your body can relese a lot of waste into your muscles and it can also relese a lot of waste into your heart sometimes your body can relese a type of fat that is supposed to be waste so now if there is no calcium in your body and there is no nutrients your body can not survive this type of thing so thats why your body and your muscles need nutrients,nutrient and vitamin be not only for tooth and bone but muscle also need nutrient and vitamin muscle carry energy with -PRON- so that -PRON- do not get weak all the time if there be no calcuim for the muscle in -PRON- body -PRON- body can relese a lot of waste into -PRON- muscle and -PRON- can also relese a lot of waste into -PRON- heart sometimes -PRON- body can relese a type of fat that be suppose to be waste so now if there be no calcium in -PRON- body and there be no nutrient -PRON- body can not survive this type of thing so that s why -PRON- body and -PRON- muscle need nutrient
nutrients are very important for the human body nutrients are important for many body parts some of these body parts include the lungs the heart and the brain however where do we get nutrients and why are they important well lets take a look at the human body after your food is made into chyme it will go into the small intestine juicesfrom the pancreas and the liver will join the chyme as well in the small intestine the juices break the nutrients from your food apart so the nutrients come from the food you eat the juices break the nutrients into molecules so small that they can be absorbed into your bloodstream your bloodstream flows up and down the body so the molecules can get to different places your blood is brought everywhere in the body so it will be brought to the body parts that need it the most after a while the nutrients will have reached the different body parts why do the nutrients go to the different body parts though well the body parts need nutrients so they can be powered just think of a treadmill a treadmill needs electricity to be powered without the treadmill wouldnt be able to function so whatim saying is without nutrients your body wouldnt be able to function however why else do we need nutrients well nutrients have many things that make your body stronger one of the things in the nutrients is vitamins calcium and vitamins are located in your nutrients all vitamins are good for your body without them you could be very weak and wouldnt be able to function that great grains are also in nutrients grains are good so your body can become stronger in strength i hope you have the same thoughts as me and i hope you have learned what you need to know,nutrient be very important for the human body nutrient be important for many body part some of these body part include the lung the heart and the brain however where do -PRON- get nutrient and why be -PRON- important well let take a look at the human body after -PRON- food be make into chyme -PRON- will go into the small intestine juicesfrom the pancreas and the liver will join the chyme as well in the small intestine the juice break the nutrient from -PRON- food apart so the nutrient come from the food -PRON- eat the juice break the nutrient into molecule so small that -PRON- can be absorb into -PRON- bloodstream -PRON- bloodstream flow up and down the body so the molecule can get to different place -PRON- blood be bring everywhere in the body so -PRON- will be bring to the body part that need -PRON- the most after a while the nutrient will have reach the different body part why do the nutrient go to the different body part though well the body part need nutrient so -PRON- can be power just think of a treadmill a treadmill need electricity to be power without the treadmill would not be able to function so whatim say be without nutrient -PRON- body would not be able to function however why else do -PRON- need nutrient well nutrient have many thing that make -PRON- body strong one of the thing in the nutrient be vitamin calcium and vitamin be locate in -PRON- nutrient all vitamin be good for -PRON- body without -PRON- -PRON- could be very weak and would not be able to function that great grain be also in nutrient grain be good so -PRON- body can become strong in strength i hope -PRON- have the same thought as -PRON- and i hope -PRON- have learn what -PRON- need to know
obviously their are many parts in your digestive system however which one is the most important i mean which organ of the digestive system does the most work well that is a very hard answer okay we can get rid of the esophagus right away why well the esophagus brings your food to your stomach but other then that the esophagus really doesnt have a big part up next is the large intestine the large intestine is important to but not as important the large intestine deabsorbs all the liquids in your waste and also brings it to the anus however this organ still isnt the main organ in the digestive system ok so we can technically go on and on about this all day however im just gonna type down the organs that dont have the biggest job and explain why appendix no use at all at least a rumor may store good bacteria but is unknown gail bladder stores sugars fats and other items like bile to help break down your food however doesnt have actual use other then storagestomach the stomach does churn the fod into chyme and absorbs it however doesnt make energyliver the liver filters all of the digestive tracts blood the liver does have a very big part of the rest of the body but not the most important organ for the digestive system so important organ but not as much for digestive system as the rest of the body pancreas the pancreas also is very important the pancreas essential roll is to convert are food into fuel for our body which is important however still isnt the most important organ in the digestive system therefore you mightve guessed that the most important organ in the the digestive system is the small intestine the small intestine is a very important organ most of our energy is made in the small intestine and it also brings the rest of our waste to the large intestine so the small intestine is the most important organn in the digestive system like you predicted p s if your body didnt have any of these organs you would die,obviously -PRON- be many part in -PRON- digestive system however which one be the most important i mean which organ of the digestive system do the most work well that be a very hard answer okay -PRON- can get rid of the esophagus right away why well the esophagus bring -PRON- food to -PRON- stomach but other then that the esophagus really do not have a big part up next be the large intestine the large intestine be important to but not as important the large intestine deabsorb all the liquid in -PRON- waste and also bring -PRON- to the anus however this organ still be not the main organ in the digestive system ok so -PRON- can technically go on and on about this all day however -PRON- be just go to type down the organ that do not have the big job and explain why appendix no use at all at least a rumor may store good bacteria but be unknown gail bladder store sugar fat and other item like bile to help break down -PRON- food however do not have actual use other then storagestomach the stomach do churn the fod into chyme and absorb -PRON- however do not make energyliver the liver filter all of the digestive tract blood the liver do have a very big part of the rest of the body but not the most important organ for the digestive system so important organ but not as much for digestive system as the rest of the body pancreas the pancreas also be very important the pancreas essential roll be to convert be food into fuel for -PRON- body which be important however still be not the most important organ in the digestive system therefore -PRON- might have guess that the most important organ in the the digestive system be the small intestine the small intestine be a very important organ most of -PRON- energy be make in the small intestine and -PRON- also bring the rest of -PRON- waste to the large intestine so the small intestine be the most important organn in the digestive system like -PRON- predict p s if -PRON- body do not have any of these organ -PRON- would die

in everyones body all of your body parts are located in the same place however what if your body parts were mixed up would your body still function the same the answer is that your body wouldnt be able to function at all all but why wouldnt the body function well lets take the digestive systemfor an example if your small intestine was before the stomach the food wouldnt even be able to go down the small intestine what i mean is the food would be too big to go down the small intestine plus the food would need to be chyme to break apart the food itself would be too hard and then the small intestine wouldnt be hooked up to your veins so the other parts of the body wouldnt get any nutrients if the body parts get no nutrients the body parts will be weak therefore if your body parts were mixed up you would die,in everyone body all of -PRON- body part be locate in the same place however what if -PRON- body part be mix up would -PRON- body still function the same the answer be that -PRON- body would not be able to function at all all but why would not the body function well let take the digestive systemfor an example if -PRON- small intestine be before the stomach the food would not even be able to go down the small intestine what i mean be the food would be too big to go down the small intestine plus the food would need to be chyme to break apart the food -PRON- would be too hard and then the small intestine would not be hook up to -PRON- vein so the other part of the body would not get any nutrient if the body part get no nutrient the body part will be weak therefore if -PRON- body part be mix up -PRON- would die

well like you said the appendix has an unknown job i do agree with you though that it might store the good bacteria i agree with you about the appendix storing the good bacteria becaus of its location the appendix is right after the end off the small intestine the waste will go onto the large intestine the large intestine will take all the waste to the rectum therefore if there was some good bacteria from the waste it couldve been brought to the appendix it could be stored there plus if the appendix is located right where the waste goes the bacteria could be delivered right to the appendix,well like -PRON- say the appendix have an unknown job i do agree with -PRON- though that -PRON- may store the good bacteria i agree with -PRON- about the appendix store the good bacteria becaus of -PRON- location the appendix be right after the end off the small intestine the waste will go onto the large intestine the large intestine will take all the waste to the rectum therefore if there be some good bacteria from the waste -PRON- could have be bring to the appendix -PRON- could be store there plus if the appendix be locate right where the waste go the bacteria could be deliver right to the appendix
well you are correct about the liver having many jobs however one thing the liver does is store your energy energy is the thing that keeps your body running after brought down the esophagus the food will be brought into the stomach after that their are enzymes that reak up sugars and fats from your food these fats and sugars will then become a energy source called adenosine triphosphate atp then atp will be brought through your bloodstream into your bodies cells the cells will than make adenosine diphosphate adp then the liver will store adp which is very important your body needs it to stay alive and strong so thanks to the liver our adp is safe,well -PRON- be correct about the liver have many job however one thing the liver do be store -PRON- energy energy be the thing that keep -PRON- body run after bring down the esophagus the food will be bring into the stomach after that -PRON- be enzyme that reak up sugar and fat from -PRON- food these fat and sugar will then become a energy source call adenosine triphosphate atp then atp will be bring through -PRON- bloodstream into -PRON- body cell the cell will than make adenosine diphosphate adp then the liver will store adp which be very important -PRON- body need -PRON- to stay alive and strong so thank to the liver -PRON- adp be safe
well you first might wonder why we need nutrients well nutrients are very important nutrients have protein grains and vitamins that your body needs without nutrients your body wouldnt be able to function at all in other words without nutrients youd be dead where do nutrients come from well they come right from the food we eat some foods have more important nutrients but all food normally has some sort of nutrient that is good for you how do we get nutrients to other body parts first the stomach will make a think called chyme chyme is a squishy mix of your food when the chyme goes to the small intestine juices from the pancreas and the liver join the chyme in the small intestine the juices help break apart the nutrients from the food into molecules small enough that can be absorbed into your bloodstream the molecules will then be brought to the body so the other body parts can get the nutrients so nutrients get to other body parts of the bloodstream,well -PRON- first may wonder why -PRON- need nutrient well nutrient be very important nutrient have protein grain and vitamin that -PRON- body need without nutrient -PRON- body would not be able to function at all in other word without nutrient -PRON- would be dead where do nutrient come from well -PRON- come right from the food -PRON- eat some food have more important nutrient but all food normally have some sort of nutrient that be good for -PRON- how do -PRON- get nutrient to other body part first the stomach will make a think call chyme chyme be a squishy mix of -PRON- food when the chyme go to the small intestine juice from the pancreas and the liver join the chyme in the small intestine the juice help break apart the nutrient from the food into molecule small enough that can be absorb into -PRON- bloodstream the molecule will then be bring to the body so the other body part can get the nutrient so nutrient get to other body part of the bloodstream
well you may be thinking what sphincters are well sphincters are things in your body that keep things like urine in a certain place when many people hear the word sphincters they think of the excratory system every  seconds urine is delivered to your bladder to prevent the urine to go out sphincters hold the urine in the bladder intil you go to the bathroom the sphincters will then be pushed to the side of the urethra so the urine can be brought to the open world in your case when you drink soda the sphincters that block of the stomach from the esophagus is opened every now so the soda can reach the stomach if it all went down at once your digestive system could be affected if you need to burp the sphincters will open letting the burp come up the esophagus thats all for now bye,well -PRON- may be think what sphincter be well sphincter be thing in -PRON- body that keep thing like urine in a certain place when many people hear the word sphincter -PRON- think of the excratory system every   second urine be deliver to -PRON- bladder to prevent the urine to go out sphincter hold the urine in the bladder intil -PRON- go to the bathroom the sphincter will then be push to the side of the urethra so the urine can be bring to the open world in -PRON- case when -PRON- drink soda the sphincter that block of the stomach from the esophagus be open every now so the soda can reach the stomach if -PRON- all go down at once -PRON- digestive system could be affect if -PRON- need to burp the sphincter will open let the burp come up the esophagus that s all for now bye
